# Hey there! 👋  

Welcome to my experimental playground on GitHub! This space is where I tinker with ideas, break things (intentionally... mostly), and explore the endless possibilities of code. Expect randomness, unfinished experiments, and the occasional stroke of brilliance. 😆  

## 🔧 What I’m Exploring  
- Web development (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS — still learning!)  
- Linux tweaks & optimizations 🐧  
- Random scripts that may or may not serve a purpose  

## 🚀 Current State of Mind  
> "Code, break, fix, repeat." – A perfectly balanced workflow. 😜  

Feel free to browse through my projects—just don’t expect perfection. If something catches your eye, let's chat!
